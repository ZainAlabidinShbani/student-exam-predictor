## 📦 Deliverables
4 Jupyter lessons (lesson1-4.ipynb)
Dataset (student_exam.csv)
Streamlit app (predictor_app.py)
README and requirements for easy setup

## 🔄 Stretch Challenge
Try to improve the model:
Add more features (e.g., health, family support)
Test Random Forest or cross-validation
Compare multiple models

##📝 Notes:
The student_exam.csv dataset is synthetic for learning purposes.

The project focuses on beginner-friendly workflow, so the model is simple and not production-ready.

Feature contributions in the Streamlit app are approximate and based on scaled logistic regression coefficients.

Feel free to extend the course by adding more features, models, or improving the app UI.
